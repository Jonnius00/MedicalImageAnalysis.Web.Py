# Assignment 1 - Clustering of Big Data. 
Task 3.  

<description>

The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive, modular, and cross-platform graphical WEB APP or Desktop or mobile application for medical image analysis. 

The core challenge is to implement the same functionality in 2 different programming languages 
and ensure they can operate on the same data and produce comparable results. 

The suite will allow users to load medical datasets, apply a pipeline of pre-processing PCA, clustering, and segmentation operations (watershed, region growing, thresholding). Implement as interchangeable strategies

THen visually compare the results and performance of the algorithms and implementations.
